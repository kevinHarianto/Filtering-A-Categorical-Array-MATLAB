# Filtering-A-Categorical-Array-MATLAB
This code snippet was helpful in determining the index of a certain String in a categorical array and in this scenario it is implemented in MATLAB
in terms of determening the x, y co ordinates of the detected objects in the point clud categorical array and displaying them.
This was tested around in the MATLAB example "Automate Ground Truth Labeling for Lidar Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Using Lidar Labeler" 
where I tested MATLABs capabilities within the lidarSemantic AI Algorithms
